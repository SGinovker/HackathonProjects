## Hackathon: YHack
### Location: Yale University
### Date: December 2018

#### Summary: 

I worked on a team with 3 other students. Our goal was to aim for jetBlue's prize, which was the best use of jetBlue data (given in JSON format). We decided to use this data to create a customer-focused jetBlue website using Wix and JavaScript. We also used the Google Places API to get information about hotels and pictures at different locations.

Website features:
* Q&A forum between customers and flight crew
* Login system for flight crew (not finished implementing)
* Search for routes based on departing or destination airport
